# Fiix's API Exercise
Welcome to Fiix's API Exercise.

This will teach you how to use Fiix's API.

The objective of this exercise is for participants to:

- Navigate our API documentation
- Set up an SDK
- Read and build a basic API application
- Make calls to and from the Fiix API 

Participants are split up into two teams. The teams are as follow:

The A Team:
- Adwait
- Colin
- Momo
- Sid

The Killer Bzz:
- Stuart
- Matt
- Julie
- Yash

# Initial exercise

Each team is provided with two CMMS tenants on the Fiix dev server. Each tenant is configured with 5 sites and 55 users (some active, some inactive). By the end of the two days, each team must be able to run a working integration that maps each of the 55 users to one of the 5 sites in the tenants. Each site must have at least one user assigned to it. It is up to the team to determine which users should be mapped to which sites. However, every user must be assigned to at least one site (this cannot be 'No Site').


## Setting up:

Download the [latest JDK from Adopt Open JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot)

Unzip this and move to your Downloads folder using `cd ~/Downloads`.  Move it using the following terminal command `sudo mv jdk-11.0.2+9 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/`, you may need to enter your password.

Once this is complete, type the following terminal command: `vi ~/.bash_profile`

Press `a`

Paste in the following: `export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2+9/Contents/Home`

Hit `esc`

Type `ZZ` (Holding Shift, hit the Z key twice).

Close and reopen the terminal, and type `java -version`

You should see:
`openjdk version "11.0.2" 2019-01-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.2+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.2+9, mixed mode)`

Download and install [STS 4](https://download.springsource.com/release/STS4/4.2.0.RELEASE/dist/e4.11/spring-tool-suite-4-4.2.0.RELEASE-e4.11.0-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.dmg)

Download this as a zip and expand to `~/Documents/learning`

You should have `~/Documents/learning/Api-Exercise-master`

Open STS, the default workspace is fine

In the **File** menu, go to **Import...**

Under the **Maven** folder, choose **Existing Maven Projects**

Select the `~/Documents/learning/Api-Exercise-master` folder

Click OK

This should import the project.

In the package explorer, you should see the `api-exercise` folder.

Right click on it and select **Run As** > **Spring Boot App**

You should see in your **Console** pane the phrase `I am learning Fiix's API!`

## Project Layout

This application has a standard Maven layout.  Source code is kept under `src/main/java`, 
configuration is kept under `src/main/resources` and tests are under `src/test/java`  As 
you will not be writing tests, you will be focusing mainly 
on files under `src/main/java`.  Under `src/main/java` you'll find a file called `user-site-group-mappings.csv`. 
 This is a sample of a csv that you will import and use to modify data over the API.

Under the root of the project is a file called `pom.xml`  This is the build and dependency 
management file.  It is often called "the pom".  Remember where this is, you will need it later.

`ApiExerciseApplication.java` is your main class.  This is the entry point to the application.

## Tips

`Command + Shift + r` pulls up the "Open Resource" window that allows you to start typing 
a file name and open any file.

You can add `System.out.println(...)` and print whatever you need to the console.  
This is useful to help you understand what's happening.
